\section*{Question 1}
\vspace{.25cm}
\noindent We are interested in how governments' management of public resources impacts economic prosperity. Our data come from \href{https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Adam_Przeworski/publication/240357392_Classifying_Political_Regimes/links/0deec532194849aefa000000/Classifying-Political-Regimes.pdf}{Alvarez, Cheibub, Limongi, and Przeworski (1996)} and is labelled \texttt{gdpChange.csv} on GitHub. The dataset covers 135 countries observed between 1950 or the year of independence or the first year forwhich data on economic growth are available ("entry year"), and 1990 or the last year for which data on economic growth are available ("exit year"). The unit of analysis is a particular country during a particular year, for a total $>$ 3,500 observations. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item
	Response variable: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{GDPWdiff}: Difference in GDP between year $t$ and $t-1$. Possible categories include: "positive", "negative", or "no change"
	\end{itemize}
	\item
	Explanatory variables: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		\texttt{REG}: 1=Democracy; 0=Non-Democracy
		\item
		\texttt{OIL}: 1=if the average ratio of fuel exports to total exports in 1984-86 exceeded 50\%; 0= otherwise
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{itemize}
\newpage
\noindent Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Construct and interpret an unordered multinomial logit with \texttt{GDPWdiff} as the output and "no change" as the reference category, including the estimated cutoff points and coefficients.
	\item Construct and interpret an ordered multinomial logit with \texttt{GDPWdiff} as the outcome variable, including the estimated cutoff points and coefficients.
	

	\begin{lstlisting}[language=R] 
	#create factors
	data_gdp$OIL <- factor(data_gdp$OIL,
	levels = c(0,1),
	labels = c("Exports < 50%", "Exports > 50%"))
	tail(data_gdp$OIL)
	
	data_gdp$GDPWdiff_cat <- cut(data_gdp$GDPWdiff, breaks = c(-Inf, -1, 1,Inf),
	labels = c("Negative", "No Change", "Positive"))
	
	levels(data_gdp$GDPWdiff_cat)
	
	#relevel
	data_gdp$GDPWdiff_cat <- relevel(data_gdp$GDPWdiff_cat, ref = "No Change")
	
	#(a)
	multi_model <- multinom(GDPWdiff_cat ~ REG + OIL, data = data_gdp)
	summary(multi_model) \end{lstlisting}
	
	Interpretation:
	A one unit increase in oil exports (oil exports > 50 percent GDP) is associated with 
	an increase of 0.57 in the log odds of negative GDP growth vs no change in a 
	given country-year. A one unit increase in oil exports is associated with an increase 
	of 0.36 in the log odds of positive growth vs no change in a given country-year
	The quality of being a democracy (REG = 1) is associated with a 1.01 increase 
	in the log odds of negative growth vs no change in a given country-year.
	The quality of being a democracy (REG = 1) is associated with a 1.4 increase in 
	the log odds of positive growth vs no change in a given country-year.
	\begin{lstlisting}[language=R] 
	ord_multi_model <- polr(GDPWdiff_cat ~ REG + OIL, data = data_gdp, Hess = TRUE) 
	summary(ord_multi_model)
	exp(coef(ord_multi_model))\end{lstlisting}
	Interpretation: The quality of being a democracy is associated with an increase of 1.5 in the 
	odds of GDP increasing or decreasing in a given year.
	A one unit increase in oil export (exports > 50 percent GDP) is associated with 0.82 increase
	in the odds of a country's GDP increasing or decreasing in a given year.
	
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Question 2} 
\vspace{.25cm}

\noindent Consider the data set \texttt{MexicoMuniData.csv}, which includes municipal-level information from Mexico. The outcome of interest is the number of times the winning PAN presidential candidate in 2006 (\texttt{PAN.visits.06}) visited a district leading up to the 2009 federal elections, which is a count. Our main predictor of interest is whether the district was highly contested, or whether it was not (the PAN or their opponents have electoral security) in the previous federal elections during 2000 (\texttt{competitive.district}), which is binary (1=close/swing district, 0="safe seat"). We also include \texttt{marginality.06} (a measure of poverty) and \texttt{PAN.governor.06} (a dummy for whether the state has a PAN-affiliated governor) as additional control variables. 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item [(a)]
	Run a Poisson regression because the outcome is a count variable. Is there evidence that PAN presidential candidates visit swing districts more? Provide a test statistic and p-value.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=R] 
pan_poisson <- glm(PAN.visits.06 ~ competitive.district + marginality.06 + 
PAN.governor.06, data=data_mex, family = poisson)
summary(pan_poisson)
errors <- summary(pan_poisson)$coefficients[, 2]
cfs <- coef(pan_poisson)
pan_poisson_z <- cfs/errors
p <- (1 - pnorm(abs(pan_poisson_z), 0, 1))*2
p
\end{lstlisting}
No, there is no evidence that PAN candidates visit swing districts more. The estimate 
for swing districts 0.921 visits on average, but this result is not 
statistically different from 0.

	\item [(b)]
	Interpret the \texttt{marginality.06} and \texttt{PAN.governor.06} coefficients.
Marginality.06 : On average, a one-unit increase in the measure of poverty is 
associated with a -2.08 decrease in the log odds of Calderon visiting to the 
district in the run up to the 2009 elections, holding all other variables constant

PAN.governor.06 : On average, the effect of a given district having a sitting 
PAN governor is associated with a -0.31 decrease in the log odds of Calderon 
visiting the district in the run up to the 2009 elections, holding all other 
variables constant. Although these effects are not statistically different from 0.
	
	\item [(c)]
	Provide the estimated mean number of visits from the winning PAN presidential candidate for a hypothetical district that was competitive (\texttt{competitive.district}=1), had an average poverty level (\texttt{marginality.06} = 0), and a PAN governor (\texttt{PAN.governor.06}=1).
\begin{lstlisting}[language=R] 
cfs <- coef(pan_poisson)
exp(cfs[1]*1 + cfs[2]*0 + cfs[3]*1)*100
\end{lstlisting}	
Estimated that Calderon would visit this hypothetical district 0.276 times in 
the run up to the 2009 election.
\end{enumerate}
